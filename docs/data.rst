Data
----
The data is from `here`_. The data is already in a GRASS GIS database. To show the import routines I exported the files
within the mapset `climate_2000_2012` with `out.l.gdal`. This mapset contains temperature and precipitation series for
the whole North Carolina from `State Climate Office of North Carolina`_.
